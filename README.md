# Peer Pulse
This platform serves as a comprehensive hub for students to access information about events, find off-campus housing, and engage in discussions with their peers.

## Introduction
Peer Pulse is a web-based solution designed to enhance the university experience by providing a single point of access for various student needs. This is the first phase of development, focusing on establishing a solid foundation with a domain-driven design and the initial API schemas.

## Project Scope - Phase 1
### Domain-Driven Design Model
We have developed a domain-driven design model that efficiently organizes the complexities of our platform, ensuring that it is student-focused and intuitive.

## API Schema Development
In this phase, each team member has contributed to the development of an API schema, focusing on different aspects of the platform:

- Events API: Developed by [Hari Sriya Pelluri]. This API handles the retrieving, creating and updating events happening in and around the NEU Boston campus.
- Housing API: Created by [Kavya Rachana Malluvalasa]. It provides information on all the available off-campus housing options in and around Boston along with option to save and retrieve from the listing.
- Channel system API: Crafted by [Raveena Ingale], this comprehensive API supports the functionalities of channels, posts, comments, and upvotes, providing a robust platform for efficient management and interaction within the community.
- User API: Developed by [Sai Krishna Reddy Gaddam], this API simplifies user interactionsâ€”retrieve details, update information, sign up, log in, and delete users.

## Creation of Rest APIs and creating database connections

In this phase, each team member has contributed to the development of an Rest API schema, focusing on different aspects of the platform:

- Events Rest API: An Events REST API is an interface that allows clients to interact with a server to perform operations related to events. In the context of web development, events could represent activities, gatherings, or occurrences that users may be interested in.
- Housings Rest API: A Housings REST API is an interface that facilitates the interaction between clients and a server for managing housing-related information. In the context of real estate or property management, this API allows users to perform operations related to housing units, such as fetching available listings
- Blogs Rest API: A Blogs REST API serves as an interface for clients to interact with a server, facilitating operations related to blog entries. This API allows users to perform actions such as fetching blog entries, creating new blog posts, updating existing posts, and deleting blog entries.
- Users Rest API: A Users REST API acts as an interface for clients to interact with a server, enabling operations related to user management. This API allows users to perform actions such as creating new user accounts, retrieving user information, updating user details, and deleting user accounts. 

## Installation and Setup
To set up the project in its current state:

Clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:info-6150-fall-2023/final-project-cohortcrafters.git 

To view the domain model or API schemas: navigate to apiSchema in the root folder


## Future Developments
1) Creation of User-Friendly User Interface
2) Implement Unit Test Cases
3) Creation of CI/CD Pipelines
4) Deploy the Application to Azure Cloud
