# Peer Pulse
This platform serves as a comprehensive hub for students to access information about events, find off-campus housing, and engage in discussions with their peers.

## Introduction
Peer Pulse is a web-based solution designed to enhance the university experience by providing a single point of access for various student needs. This is the first phase of development, focusing on establishing a solid foundation with a domain-driven design and the initial API schemas.

## Project Scope - Phase 1
### Domain-Driven Design Model
We have developed a domain-driven design model that efficiently organizes the complexities of our platform, ensuring that it is student-focused and intuitive.

## API Schema Development
In this phase, each team member has contributed to the development of an API schema, focusing on different aspects of the platform:

- Events API: Developed by [Hari Sriya Pelluri]. This API handles the retrieving, creating and updating events happening in and around the NEU Boston campus.
- Housing API: Created by [Kavya Rachana Malluvalasa]. It provides information on all the available off-campus housing options in and around Boston along with option to save and retrieve from the listing.
- Discussion Forum API: Crafted by [Raveena Ingale], this API facilitates the posting and management of discussion threads.
- User API: Developed by [Sai Krishna Reddy Gaddam], this API simplifies user interactionsâ€”retrieve details, update information, sign up, log in, and delete users.

## Installation and Setup
To set up the project in its current state:

Clone the repository: git clone [https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project]

To view the domain model or API schemas: navigate to apiSchema in the root folder

## Future Development
1) Creation of Database Schemas
2) Creation of Rest APIs
3) Creation of User-Friendly User Interface
4) Implement Unit Test Cases
5) Creation of CI/CD Pipelines
6) Deploy the Application to Azure Cloud
