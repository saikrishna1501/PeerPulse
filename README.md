# Peer Pulse
This platform serves as a comprehensive hub for students to access information about events, find off-campus housing, and engage in discussions with their peers.

## Introduction
Peer Pulse is a web-based solution designed to enhance the university experience by providing a single point of access for various student needs. This is the first phase of development, focusing on establishing a solid foundation with a domain-driven design and the initial API schemas.

## Project Scope - Phase 1
### Domain-Driven Design Model
We have developed a domain-driven design model that efficiently organizes the complexities of our platform, ensuring that it is student-focused and intuitive.
